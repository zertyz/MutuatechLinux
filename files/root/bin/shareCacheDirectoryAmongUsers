# Shares the contents of a directory on a user's home among all other users, so that only one copy of that information is used on the machine.

# usage:
# 1) ass root, 'cd' to the user's home
# 2) /root/bin/shareCacheDirectoryAmongUsers [directory-to-share]

# the following will be performed:
# 1) the given 'directory-to-share' will be moved to /home/common
# 2) a link to it will be placed on /home/new_user
# 3) all other directories in /home will have their 'directory-to-share' removed and replaced by a link to /home/common/directory-to-share
# 4) /home/common/sbin/fixCommonPermissions will be run to make it writable by everyone
